# MOODIFY-learning
Number of Maximum 1's added is 1160
This Assignment of MOODIFY-learning is based on a basic Virus spread simulator. We have taken a grid(a 2D np array) of dimension 100 x 150 and each block represents a person 
Value 0 means not affected and 1 means affected by the virus 
In this project I have used modules like numpy, matplotlib and random 
simple functions like 
### travel() - which simulates the swapping of values on random basis 
### effecton_neigh1() and effecton_neigh2 - as their name suggests they simulate the effect on the first and second neighbours of an affected person. A person who is a first neighbour of an infected person has a 25% chance of contracting the virus while a second neighbour has a 0.08 % chance of contracting it
