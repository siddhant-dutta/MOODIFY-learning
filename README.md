# INDEX (MOODIFY-learning) 
### Assignment1
- Based on making a Virus spread simulator and plotting different graphs to analyse it 
### Assignment_2
- Problem1 - A linear regression model to predict the average monthly spend of new customers 
- Problem2 - A logistic regression model to predict the labels coressponding to the new features in the form of yes (1) or no (0)
### Assignment_3
In this assignment I have used Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification <br>
- Problem2 - In this mini project I have used the MNIST Data of hand written digits and made a neural network model to classify the handwritten digits<br>
 For this I have used the Tensorflow library and particularly the keras API of tensorflow to build the model
