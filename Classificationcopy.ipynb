In other words, classification models are **supervised** machine learning models which predict a categorical label.\n",

In this case, the cost to the bank of issuing a loan to a bad risk customer is five times that of denying a loan to a good customer. This fact will become important when evaluating the performance of the model. \n",

You can think of this response as having a Binomial distribution. For linear regression the response is just, well, linear. Logistic regression is a linear regression model with a nonlinear output. The response of the linear model is transformed or 'squashed' to values close to 0 and 1 using a **sigmoidal function**, also known as the **logistic function**. The result of this transformation is a response which is the log likelihood for each of the two classes. \n",

The naive 'classifier' produced accuracy that was only somewhat worse as a result of the class imbalance.  The confusion matrix and the precision, recall and F1 statistics gave meaningful measures of model performance, especially when considered together. \n",
